Assignment 1\
By Asaf Rozen and Aharon Gross


This is a program to calculate the distance between 2 vectors (user input) according to a couple different calculating algorithms including:\
Minkowski distance algorithm\
Euclidean distance algorithm\
Manhattan distance algorithm\
Chebyshev distance algorithm\
Canberra distance algorithm


Geometry.cpp icludes the algorithms listed above, including other functions needed for recieving the user input and translating it into vectors.\
Main.cpp includes a simple example of running the algorithms.



How to run the program:\
