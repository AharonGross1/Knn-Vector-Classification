# Ass2
part 2 of advanced programming class

In this assignment the program recievs input from the user indicating how and where to run a knn algorithm.
The algorithm classifies an unclassified vector according to a list with classified vectors.
The k of the algorithm - the number of the k closest classified vectors to classify the vector with, is given as iput.

To run the program:

make

./output {variable k-num} {variable file you want to read} {variable distance function}
